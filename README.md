# MIT COVID-19 Challenge
The [MIT COVID-19 Challenge](https://covid19challenge.mit.edu/about/) event, Beat the Pandemic, is the second in a series of virtual hackathons. Over the course of two days, multi-disciplinary teams will collaborate to develop innovative solutions that can help address the COVID-19 crisis. We are focused on connecting teams with the tools and resources needed to develop mature solutions that can be implemented by our partners. After the Challenge, selected teams will have the opportunity to bring their solutions to life with the support of our partners.  

The next event is April 3-5, 2020. In this 48-hour virtual event, we will help tackle the most critical unmet needs caused by the COVID-19 outbreak.

<summary><strong>PROTECTING VULNERABLE POPULATIONS</strong></summary>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Track A. Expanding and improving access to COVID-19 education and resources:</h5>
How do we keep community residents with limited/poor access to COVID-19 information and available community resources up-to-date to ensure basic needs are being met (e.g. shelters, pantries)? As telehealth becomes essential and remote monitoring tools are adopted, how do we ensure that vulnerable populations are connected, have access, and can utilize high-speed internet options quickly (i.e. reduce the complicated process to show eligibility)?

<h5>Track B. Who to test and when?:</h5>
How do we appropriately and more efficiently identify patients and health care workers that should be tested for COVID19? With limited testing available and results taking longer, how can we speed up the process and better triage the testing and the test reporting? How can we identify and monitor patients and health care workers who may be at higher-risk exposure or have pre-existing conditions that might be more adversely affected? How do we predict who will worsen rapidly and need higher level care more urgently?
</li>
<li>
<h5>Track C. At-Home Patient Triaging:</h5>
How do we better educate the more at-risk and vulnerable populations on how to accurately monitor their symptoms, and triage them to prevent them for coming in to an overwhelmed ED when they don’t need to? How do we provide mechanisms for self-assessments and remote assessments to more quickly and accurately identify patients who need to come into the hospital vs. those who can continue to stay home?
</li>
<li>
<h5>Track D. COVID-19 Treatment and Management:</h5>
The clinical treatment of COVID-19 has become a decentralized non-controlled clinical trial. How do we best collect the data to determine what if any are the best clinical pathways for the most vulnerable and higher risk patients at different age groups, ethnicity, comorbidities, etc.? How can we quickly collaborate and share information across all the silos within our systems, with other systems, and with healthcare professionals at large? How do we more rapidly vet and distribute new findings, best practices, high quality data globally as it becomes available?
</li>
<li>
<h5>Track E. Impact of Social Distancing and Quarantines:</h5>
As patients both inside the hospital and outside in the community continue to stay in isolation, practice social distancing, and quarantines, how do we address the consequences of these measures? Such consequences for patients with no visitor policies, no access to smart phones, or in home isolation can include loneliness, mental well-being, and quality of life. Are there alternate ways at-home care personnel (medical, educational, daily living) can continue to provide services, in spite of the challenges of physical distancing?

<summary><strong>HELPING HEALTH SYSTEMS</strong></summary>
<ul>

<h5>Track F. Identifying the COVID-19 Immune:</h5>
We need to develop methods to identify immunity status that are reliable and non-healthcare system intensive. This will allow people to return to the workforce without hijacking the scarce resources of the healthcare system that should be directed to the critically ill.
</li>
<li>
<h5>Track G. New ways to deliver care in a COVID-19 World:</h5>
What alternative health care delivery models could we harness to eliminate gaps in care intensified (or brought about) by the current situation? Although telehealth is a good large-scale example, what else is out there?
</li>
<li>
<h5>Track H. Hospital Assets Coordination, and Distribution: </h5>
Coordination – How to coordinate and communicate the needs of hospital system (medical supplies, lab supplies, research supplies, medical equipment, food, electronics, donations) and how to provide appropriate channels to automatically process or redirect appropriately on intake. Distribution – How do we provide a less hands-on automated way to distribute PPE to staff?
</li>
<li>
<h5>Track I. Space conversion, utility, and projections:</h5>
As cities prepare for continued community spread and potential surge in COVID-19 patients, many are looking for new ways to convert existing spaces to treat more COVID-19 patients while finding new spaces to separate non-COVID-19 patients such as hospital tents. How can we more efficiently and creatively provide new expandable places, flex existing spaces based on active needs, provide better predictions on upcoming needs? Could we take advantage of available data to help inform hospitals to plan for surge capacity? Additionally, how can we retro-fit non-hospital spaces such as hotels, and other unused spaces to support non-COVID-19 patients so that hospital-based spaces can focus on COVID-19 patients?
</li>
<li>
<h5>Track J. Health care workforce well-being, management, training:</h5>
As the impact of COVID-19 on hospital systems and health care workforces continues, how can we best help hospitals quickly shift human resources, redeploy healthcare workers appropriately based on skills sets, and quickly train current/new healthcare workers to fill certain needs of the health system while protecting the physical and mental well-being of our healthcare workforce?

## Track-H (The track I worked on)
### Description <!-- omit in toc --> 
The track which I chose is the **H-TRACK** I'm used to logistics algorithms, I've been working at a lot of resembling algorithms. 
### Problem <!-- omit in toc -->
"*Tackle the problem of hospitals not receiving supplies due to overstocking in other hospitals. Also, efficient networking of these medical facilities and making one dataset of rates for various resources would give us a very accurate estimate*"
### Summary of Solution
The main idea is Heatmaping. 
Short description:

The idea was improved via volunteer centers, it has to optimize delivering velocity, by setting them up amid hospitals and other health-institutions). 
With vast explanation of the solution you can check repository out.

## TODO
- replenish the README.md
